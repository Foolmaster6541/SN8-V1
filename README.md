# SN8-V1
These are my SN8 scripts, They may not work for some if you have things like FAR or RSS installed. Don't change the LatLng of the landing zone unless you have kOS Experience. These may not be accurate or perfect.

Make sure you have all the required mods
If you do use this in a video then you must leave a link in the description to this Github page.
You can use it for private use, I don't mind!

# Make sure to keep all the folders the same way they came, unless you have kOS experiance.

Thanks to ElixerSpaceTech for some of the guidence in this script.
